"In machine learning, the task of classification means to use the available data to learn a function which can assign a category to a data point. For example, assign a genre to a movie, like ""Romantic Comedy"", ""Action"", ""Thriller"". Another example could be automatically assigning a category to news articles, like ""Sports"" and ""Politics",0.53,0.07,0.22,0.77,0.15,0.11
"We determine the asymptotics of the independence number of the random d-regular graph for all 𝑑≥𝑑0. It is highly concentrated, with constant-order fluctuations around 𝑛𝛼∗−𝑐∗log𝑛 for explicit constants 𝛼∗(𝑑) and 𝑐∗(𝑑). Our proof rigorously confirms the one-step replica symmetry breaking heuristics for this problem, and we believe the techniques will be more broadly applicable to the study of other combinatorial properties of random graphs.",0.26,0.3,0.79,0.23,0.08,0.11
"Quantitative Biology is an interdisciplinary journal that focuses on original research that uses quantitative approaches and technologies to analyze and integrate biological systems, construct and model engineered life systems, and to gain a deeper understanding of life sciences. It aims to provide a platform for not only the analysis but also the integration and construction of biological systems. It is a quarterly journal seeking to provide an inter- and multi-disciplinary forum for a broad blend of peer-reviewed academic papers, in order to promote rapid communications among scientists",0.61,0.43,0.29,0.17,0.34,0.18
